DDoS Detection and Mitigation Script
This project is a Python script for detecting and mitigating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on a network. It continuously monitors network traffic, analyzes packet rates, and takes actions to mitigate DDoS attacks when detected.

Features
Continuous Monitoring: The script continuously monitors network traffic to detect abnormal packet rates.
Threshold-Based Detection: DDoS attacks are detected based on predefined thresholds for packet rates and time intervals.
Mitigation Actions: When a DDoS attack is detected, the script takes various mitigation actions such as blocking the attacker's IP, rate-limiting traffic, diverting traffic to a sinkhole IP, and changing routes.
Configurability: Threshold values, mitigation actions, and other parameters can be configured based on the network environment.
External Reputation Service: Optionally, the script can query an external reputation service to determine if an IP address is malicious.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
requests: for making HTTP requests
scapy: for packet sniffing and manipulation
tcconfig: for configuring network traffic shaping
Other standard Python libraries
Usage
Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests scapy tcconfig
Configure the script:

Set internal IP ranges using set_internal_ip_ranges() function.
Set threshold values for detecting DDoS attacks using set_threshold_values() function.
Configure mitigation actions, such as sinkhole IP, new route IP, and reputation service URL.
Optionally, configure traffic shaping parameters using set_traffic_shaping_params() function.
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python ddos_detection.py
